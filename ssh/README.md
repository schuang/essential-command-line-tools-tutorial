# ssh

## ssh key pair example

    - generated by the command: `ssh-keygen -C "demo_test"` then press "Enter"
      for all prompts"
    - [public key](id_rsa_test.pub)
    - [private key](id_rsa_test.pub)

## ssh configuration example

    - [~/.ssh/config](config)

## permission

For the key pair to work properly, the permission of cerntain files needs to be
set correctly.

### On the client side

(e.g. your laptop computer)

```
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_test    # the private key

```

### On the server side

(e.g. the remote HPC server/cluster)

The `id_rsa_test.pub` generated on your laptop (see above) is copied to the
server, and appended to the file `.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

```
