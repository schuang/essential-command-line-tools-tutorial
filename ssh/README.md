# ssh

## ssh key pair example

- generated by the command: `ssh-keygen -C "demo_test"` then press "Enter"
  for all prompts"
- [public key](id_rsa_test.pub)
- [private key](id_rsa_test)

## ssh configuration example

(e.g. on your laptop computer)

- [~/.ssh/config](config)

## permission

For the key pair to work properly, the permission of cerntain files needs to be
set correctly.

### On the client side

(e.g. your laptop computer)

```
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_test    # the private key

```

### On the server side

(e.g. the remote HPC server/cluster)

The `id_rsa_test.pub` generated on your laptop (see above) is copied to the
server, and *appended* to the file `.ssh/authorized_keys` 
ï¼ˆ**do not overwrite the file; you might have other keys in it already**), e.g.

```
cat id_rsa_test.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
```

To ensure correct persmission, run these commands:

```
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   # contains the public key

```

## Login

(On the laptop computer)

```
$ ssh login1
```
See the "login1" entry in [ssh config file](config).
