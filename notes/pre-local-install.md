# Local installation

If you are going to install the tools on your local computer, or under your own
account on a supercomputer/cluster account, you will need to install these
packages yourself. In the case of local computer, some internet/Google search
will tell you that you may be able to use the
system's package manager (such as `apt` on Ubuntu Linux, `yum` on
RedHat/CentOS/Fedora Linux, or `brew` on macOS) to simply the installation
process. All of these commands require
system adminstrator prividge, which you don't have if you want to do this on a
supercomputer/cluster account.

supercomputers that you have access to, you can follow these instructions. All
of the tools are free available. After installation, you also need to set up the
environment variable (such as `PATH`), or add them to the shell initialization
file (e.g. `.bashrc`) so that they can be executed when you run the command(s)
in a terminal.

On your local computer, you might simplify the process by using the package
manager (such as ``apt`` on Ubuntu Linux, or ``brew`` on macOS). However,
the particular version you can get depends on the package manager. Some package
managers may offer only older versions.
