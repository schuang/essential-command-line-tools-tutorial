# Prerequite

To follow along with the class, you are expected to have completed either
one of the two things prior to attending the class:

1. (easy) Have a [Hoffman2 cluster
   account](https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/getting-started/#newuser) and are
   able to log in.  For more details, see: [Using the packages on Hoffman2
   cluster](pre-h2.md)
2. (work required) Have a POSIX-compliant computer (e.g. macOS, Linux or Windows
   with Cygwin, either as a phyaical machine or a virtual machine) and have
   completed the installation of all packages. Please note: you are responsible
   for installing them prior to the class. Some installation tips are posted
   here for your reference but I may be unable to help you with the specifics of
   your computer: [Installation on Local computer](pre-local-install.md)
