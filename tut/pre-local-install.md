# Local installation

To install these tools on your computer, either your laptop computer or the
supercomputers that you have access to, you can follow these instructions. All
of the tools are free available. After installation, you need to set up the 
environment variable (such as `PATH`), or add them to the shell initialization
file (e.g. `.bashrc`) so that they can be executed when you run the command(s)
in a terminal.

- Install vim
- Install pandoc
- Install tmux
- Install git

On your laptop computer, you might simplify the process by using the package
manager (such as ``apt`` on Ubuntu Linux, or ``brew`` on macOS). However,
the particular version you can get depends on the package manager. Some package
managers may offer only older versions.
