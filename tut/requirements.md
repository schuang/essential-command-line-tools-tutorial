# Requirements

## Hoffman2 Cluster

All of these command-line tools are available on the Hoffman2 cluster. To load
them:

### vim

```
module load vim
```

Note that some vim features are only availble in version 8.1 or newer.


### pandoc

```
module load pandoc
```

### tmux

```
module load tmux
```

### git

```
module load git
```

## On your computer

To get these tools on your computer, either your laptop computer or the
supercomputers that you have access to, you can following these steps:

- Installing vim
- Install pandoc
- Install tmux
- Install git

On your laptop computer, you might simplify the process by using the package
manager (such as ``apt`` on Ubuntu Linux, or ``brew`` on macOS). However,
the particular version you can get depends on the package manager. Some package
managers may offer only older versions.
