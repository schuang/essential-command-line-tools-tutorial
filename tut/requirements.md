# Requirements

Some versions of these command-line tools may be available by default on your
computer system. But we want to use newer versions to benefit from the lastest
new features. The following instructions detail how to get to these newer
versions. 


## Hoffman2 Cluster

All of these command-line tools are available on the Hoffman2 cluster. To load
them into your environment, use the following commands.

### vim

```
module load vim
```

Note that some vim features are only availble in version 8.1 or newer.


### pandoc

```
module load pandoc
```

### tmux

```
module load tmux
```

### git

```
module load git
```

## On your computer

To get these tools on your computer, either your laptop computer or the
supercomputers that you have access to, you can follow these instructions. All
of the tools are free available.

- Installing vim
- Install pandoc
- Install tmux
- Install git

On your laptop computer, you might simplify the process by using the package
manager (such as ``apt`` on Ubuntu Linux, or ``brew`` on macOS). However,
the particular version you can get depends on the package manager. Some package
managers may offer only older versions.
