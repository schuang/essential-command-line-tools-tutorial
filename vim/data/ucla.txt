The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)[1] is a public research
university in Los Angeles. UCLA traces its early origins back to 1882 as the
southern branch of the California State Normal School (now San Jose State
University). It became the Southern Branch of the University of California in
1919, making it the second-oldest (after UC Berkeley) of the 10-campus
University of California system. The oldest of the UC campuses in Southern
California, some consider it to be one of the systemâ€™s flagship campuses
alongside UC Berkeley.[11]

UCLA offers 337 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a wide range of
disciplines,[12] enrolling about 31,500 undergraduate and 12,800 graduate
students.[7] UCLA had 119,000 applicants for Fall 2016, including transfer
applicants, making the school the most applied-to of any American
university.[13]
