# Essential Command-line Tools for HPC

## Description

On POSIX-complaint systems, such as macOS, Linux or Windows with Cygwin, a
number of command-line tools are available that can significantly streamline the
daily tasks of a researcher working with advanced computing or data analysis.
Unlike their graphical user interface counterparts, which appears to be
prevalent in today's computing environments, these command-line tools can
provides (almost) infinitie flexibility, efficiency and reproducibility when
used properly.  In this tutorial, we will discuss and explain a number of
command line tools by motivating examples or use cases.  Due to time contraint,
each topic is not expected to be the exhaustic coverage of the tool.  All of
these tools are free available and can be installed from laptop computers to
supercomputers.  Specifically, we will discuss:

- text file basics
- useful features of text editors
- pandoc (file format converter)
- tmux (terminal multiplexier)
- ssh (secure shell): beyond a login tool
- git (version control): understanding the basics
- examples line-oriented data processing and scripting
