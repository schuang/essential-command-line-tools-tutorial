# Essential Command-line Tools for HPC

## Description

In POSIX-compliant computing environments, such as macOS, Linux or Windows with
Cygwin, a number of versatile, time-tested command-line open-source tools with
text-based user interface (TUI) are available to support performing common
tasks that arise in scientific computing and data analysis.  Unlike their
graphical user interface (GUI) counterparts, which appear to be prevalent in
today's computing environments, these command-line tools can achieve (almost)
infinitie flexibility, efficiency and reproducibility if used properly.  For
example, when connecting to a remote server (e.g. a computing cluster), using
the text-based tool is lightweight and fast without the overhead of launching
the X11/graphical server on the local computer.  Using text-based tools is not
as hard (or mysterious) as it may sound once the basics are understood.  Once
using TUI becomes muscle memory, one can focus on the subject of
interest/research (e.g. editing a script/program or writing a maniscript)
instead of operating the complex GUI. In this class, we will explain and
demonstrate a number of popular text-based command line tools.  We will also discuss
useful tips of configuring (customizing) these tools.  All of these tools can
be easily installed on a personal computer, a remote (or "cloud") server, or
one's supercomputer account without superuser priviledge.  Their use is
identical across the platforms, and they are expect to exist for many years to
come.  Specifically, we will discuss the following topics:

- text editors: demo of useful features
- text files: a closer look
- ssh (secure shell): beyond a login tool
- git (version control): understanding the jargons
- tmux (terminal multiplexier): robust persistent console 
- shell and shell script basics: important tips
- examples of line-oriented data processing
- examples of command-line utilities

Due to time contraints, each topic is not expected to be an exhaustive
discussion of the underlying tools.
