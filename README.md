# Essential Command-line Tools for HPC

## Description

On macOS, Linux, or Windows with Cygwin, or other POSIX-compliant environments,
a number of versatile, time-tested command-line open-source tools with
text-based user interface (TUI) are available to support performing common
tasks that arise in advanced computation or data analysis. Unlike their
graphical user interface (GUI) counterparts, which appear to be prevalent in
today's computing environments, these command-line tools can achieve (almost)
infinite flexibility, efficiency, and reproducibility if used properly. For
example, when connecting with a remote server (e.g. a computing cluster), using
the text-based tool is lightweight and fast without the overhead of launching
the X11/graphical server on the local computer. Using text-based tools is not
as hard (or mysterious) as it may sound once the basics are understood. Once
using TUI becomes muscle memory, one can focus on the subject of
interest/research (e.g. editing a script/program or writing a manuscript)
instead of operating the complex GUI. In this class, we will explain and
demonstrate a number of such text-based command-line tools by examples and use
cases.  We will also discuss useful tips for configuring (customizing) these
tools. All of these tools can be easily installed on a personal computer, a
remote (or "cloud") server, or one's supercomputer account without superuser
privilege. Their use is identical across the platforms, and they are expected
to exist for many years to come.  Specifically, we will explore the following
topics:

- text editors: demo of useful features
- text files: a closer look
- ssh (secure shell): beyond a login tool
- git (version control): understanding the jargons
- tmux (terminal multiplexer): robust persistent console
- shell and shell script basics: important tips
- examples of line-oriented data processing
- examples of command-line utilities

Due to time constraints, each topic is not expected to be an exhaustive
discussion of the underlying tools.
