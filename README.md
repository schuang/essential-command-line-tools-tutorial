# Essential Command-line Tools for HPC

## Description

On POSIX-complaint computer systems, such as macOS, Linux or Windows with
Cygwin, a number of command-line tools are available that can significantly
streamline the daily tasks of a researcher working with advanced computation or
data analysis.  Unlike their graphical user interface (GUI) counterparts, which
appears to be prevalent in today's computing environments, these command-line
tools can help to achieve (almost) infinitie flexibility, efficiency and
reproducibility if used properly. For example, when connecting with a remote
server, the text interface is lightweight and faster than GUI without the hassle
and overhead of launching the local X11/graphical server.  Using the command
line tools are not as hard (or mysterious) as it may sound once the basics are
understood.  For example, it is possible to operate at the speed of muscle
memory without touching the computer mouse when editing a program.  In this
class, we will discuss and explain a number of command line tools by motivating
examples or use cases.  We will also discuss some useful tips of configuring
(customizing) these tools for common use patterns.  All of these tools are free
available and can be installed on laptop computers, a remote/cloud server, or
one's supercomputer account.

Specifically, the following topics will be discussed:

- text editors
- text files
- pandoc (file format converter)
- tmux (terminal multiplexier)
- ssh (secure shell): beyond a login tool
- git (version control): understanding the basics
- shell and shell script basics
- examples line-oriented data processing

Due to time contraint, each topic is not expected to be an exhaustic coverage of
the tool.
