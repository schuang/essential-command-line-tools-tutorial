# Essential Command-line Tools for HPC

## Description

In POSIX-complaint computing environments, such as macOS, Linux or Windows with
Cygwin, a number of command-line tools with text-based user interface (TUI) are
available that can support performing common tasks in advanced computation or
data analysis.  Unlike their graphical user interface (GUI) counterparts, which
appear to be prevalent in today's computing environments, these command-line
tools can achieve (almost) infinitie flexibility, efficiency and reproducibility
if used properly.  For example, when connecting with a remote server, using the
text-based tool is lightweight and fast without the overhead (and hassle) of
launching the  X11/graphical server on the local computer.  Using the text-based
tools are not as hard (or mysterious) as it may sound once the basics are
understood.  Once the user is familiar with it, it is possible to operate at the
speed of muscle memory (e.g. without touching the computer mouse) when editing
programs or texts.  We will discuss, explain and demonstrate a number of
text-based command line tools by examples and use cases.  We will also discuss
useful tips of configuring (customizing) these tools.  All of these tools
are free available and can be easily installed on a laptop/desktop computer, a
remote (or "cloud") server, or one's supercomputer account.  The use of these
tools are identical across the platforms. Specifically, the following topics
will be covered:

- text editors
- text files: a closer look
- ssh (secure shell): beyond a login tool
- git (version control): understanding the jargons
- pandoc (file format converter): life simplified by plain texts
- tmux (terminal multiplexier): persistent and reconnectable console 
- shell and shell script basics
- examples line-oriented data processing

Due to time contraint, each topic is not expected to be an exhaustive coverage of
the underlying tool.
